<p>The reasons for registering and running services on doppelg채nger domains vary widely with either mischievous or malicious intent. It could be for a lark; to make a political statement; to embarrass or harass, or as part of a broader cyber attack strategy. In all cases, the intent is to re-direct traffic (the web, email etc.) away from the legitimate domain and to the doppelg채nger domain.</p>
